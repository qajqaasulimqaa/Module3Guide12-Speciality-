In this project I used:

APIs:

Weather API — required fetching an API key.

Google Maps API — also required fetching an API key from the Google Cloud website.

Script:
Unfortunately, I forgot to read the project description thoroughly and wrote everything in Java instead of TypeScript.

JavaScript elements used:

Adding HTML elements dynamically through JavaScript.

Creating animations with JavaScript.

Implementing a simple but effective image slider.

Adding a movable icon at the top of the page.

Enjoy!
